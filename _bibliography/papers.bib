  abstract = {I seek to positively understand the institutional patterns behind system-wide, voluntary metabolism restructurings like degrowth. While economy-wide degrowth is not observable in all of its dimensions, specific aspects can be informed in certain cases. Cuba during the ``Special Period'' in the 1990s is an example where a drastic metabolism reduction was partly decoupled from progress in social indicators. To integrate socioeconomic and biophysical analysis---still lacking in degrowth research--- I combine regulation theory and socioeconomic metabolism. I also introduce a new type of Sankey diagram that incorporates non-technical information external to the datasets. In the Cuban case, initial institutions such as planning, rationing, extended social security, and the absence of hegemonic market relations proved pivotal---though ultimately insufficient---in managing living conditions under biophysical contraction. Further adaptations included State support for grassroots initiatives, partial polycentrization of the planning system or double-track mechanisms combining planning and markets. The absence of democracy, however, precluded systemic post-growth change, lending empirical support to one of the core hypotheses of degrowth theory. These elements are synthesized within the regulation theory framework to suggest that a degrowth mode of production may imply basic needs logics instead of market social relations. Degrowth regimes likely imply planning and only partial decentralization. The diversity and specific features of degrowth-compatible modes of regulation remain open to debate. Further comparative research within the provided framework is needed to refine the characterization of such socioeconomic and biophysical regimes.},
