I am a PhD student in political and ecological economics based in Grenoble, France. I investigate the institutions enabling sustainability in the form of degrowth, the properties of degrowth regimes, and how this can inform strategies for deep economic change. I use Regulation Theory and socioeconomic metabolism analysis. 

I work under the supervision of Agnès Labrousse and Pierre-Yves Longaretti. 
I graduated in social sciences and economics at the ENS Paris-Saclay. 

I am part of the current coordination group of the [Postgrowth Economics Network](https://www.postgrowtheconomics.org/). 
I also co-organize an ecological economics seminar in Grenoble, the [ReGEE](https://rencontres-ecol-econ.github.io/).
